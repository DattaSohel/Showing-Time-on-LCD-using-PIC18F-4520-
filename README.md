# Showing-Time-on-LCD-using-PIC18F-4520-
This Project Is used to show Time, Date &amp; Digital Clock on the Screen using PIC18F 4520 microcontroller 

 The project aims to create a digital clock that displays the current time on an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) using the 
PIC18F4520 microcontroller. The project involves designing the hardware connections and writing the necessary 
firmware code to interface with the microcontroller and LCD module. The PIC18F4520 microcontroller serves as the 
core of the project, responsible for timekeeping, processing, and controlling the LCD display. It features built- 
in peripherals, such as timers and interrupts, which are utilized to accurately measure time and update the 
display.
